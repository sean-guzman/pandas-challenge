    "In this analysis, data is taken from a school district where a series of calculations are performed to determine its success as a district, as well as by school, type of school, school spending.  The data is broken down even further by grade to uncover any trends as students progress through high school.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways and Conclusions\n",
    "- As a district, it averaged a 78.99 for Math and 81.88 for Reading. While the majority passed each subject respectively (Math - 74.98%, Reading 85.81%), only 65% of students passed both.\n",
    "- Scores for both Math and Reading appear to stay relatively the same throughout high school.\n",
    "- Spending more per student does not necessarily yield higher Overall Passing Percentages as shown in the spending summary dataframe but given the data, schools with smaller student populations have a higher Overall Passing Percentage despite having smaller budgets as shown in the school summary dataframe.\n",
    "- Further validating the previous point, the 5 highest-performing schools of passing overall are charter schools (where budget and size are both smaller), whereas the lowest-performing are district schools.  Charter schools excel in all categories [ Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, Passing Math Percentage, Passing Reading Percentage, Overall Passing Percentage ] over district schools as shown in the type_summary dataframe.\n",
    "- Scores and percentages in all categories [ Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, Passing Math Percentage, Passing Reading Percentage, Overall Passing Percentage ] improve signifcantly depending on size/number of students as shown in the size_summary dataframe. Higher marks in these categories can be seen Medium size schools (1000-2000 students) versus Large size schools (over 2000 students).  However, little improvement can be seen, if any, when comparing Medium size schools to Small size schools (less than 1000 students)."
